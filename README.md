# SchoolManagementSystem

## Introduction

This project is about making a simple School management system, where there will be inside this project 2 main steps (and sub-projects):
* Student: This subproject is going to be all the student being registered inside of the application. Of course there are none right now
as it is only stub data (that doesn't exist anyway). This sub-project will contin everything that is needed to keep some persistency between
each start and stop of the application. Right now is going to keep the student's information inside of a sqlite database, and later-on
it will PERHAPS use something more than SQLite to persist the student's informations.

* Teacher: This subproject is going to be the teacher part of the project, this part is going to be devided into 2 main part:
    - Courses, that is going to keep all the course / evaluations of a teacher
    - Homework, that is going to contain all the homework a user is giving to students

So far now, the idea is just this simple, although this application is going to be bigger than this small application.
Hence, this application will also make me learn Qt more deeply than I currently.
